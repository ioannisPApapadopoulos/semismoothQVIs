# semismoothQVIs

### Synopsis ###

A firedrake implementation of the semismooth Newton method for obstacle-type quasivariational inequalities as described in

"A globalized inexact semismooth Newton method for nonsmooth fixed point equations involving variational inequalities" (2024), A. Alphonse, C. Christof, M. Hinterm√ºller, I. P. A. Papadopoulos

The implementation trick is to leverage one step of vinewtonrsls in PETSc in order to implement the active-set. This package works in parallel.

### Dependencies and installation ###


The code is written in Python using Firedrake: a finite element solver platform. Firedrake is well documented here: firedrakeproject.org.

First install Firedrake: https://www.firedrakeproject.org/download.html. Make sure to activate the Firedrake venv and run a firedrake-clean!

    source firedrake/firedrake/bin/activate
    firedrake-clean

Then download and pip install the semismoothQVIs library:

    git clone https://github.com/ioannisPApapadopoulos/semismoothQVIs.git
    cd semismoothQVIs/
    pip3 install .
    cd ../
